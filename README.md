This script allows you to access a non-business google voice account and send text messages to find motivated sellers. The script takes a skiptraced file of phone numbers and texts each person - one after another to not raise any red flags with google. This opens a free marketing strategy that beats direct mail or paid text marketing - which costs up to 6 cents per text message. Currently, this software can safely text up to ?????? individuals each day without risking being locked out by google. The input speed was adjusted to simulate a real human interacting with google voice.
